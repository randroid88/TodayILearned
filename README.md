# Android Practice App
Google as added quite a few new capabilities to Android since I first started working with the platform. My goal is to built an app from the ground up while using the latest tools and best practices.

# Today I Learned
To start, the app I build will be pretty basic. Essential it is a journaling app that could grow to be a social network. Each day the user can enter one journal entry for the prompt "Today I Learned...". 
</br> It can be funny like the TIL meme:

</br>
But my vision is that it would be used by avid learners to highlight a skill they improved. For example, I might have an entry about my latest understanding of Android Rooms.
A user could then scroll through the days and see everything they have been learning.

</br></br>
More advance features might include:
* The ability to back up entries and sync across multiple devices
* Different message types like audio, short video clips, or images
* Sharing entries through different platforms (e.g. Twitter)
* A calendar to more easily navigate through older entries
* Social features that show other people's published entries


# Latest Tools and Best Practices
Where applicable, I want to try and use the following while building this app:
* Test-Driven Development
* [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/)
* [Databinding Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)
* [Room Persistance Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/)
